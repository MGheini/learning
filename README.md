### Rapid world, too much information, way too many things to learn, better write my progress down!

My life has changed in the past 10 months at an unprecedented, overwhelming pace, like never before. My mind has been filled with thoughts like no other time. In situations like mine, the need to write every single thing down becomes inevitable. So there are lots of things that I need to write dowe. This page however, is dedicated to tracing my learning journey. It's going to help me stay motivated and on track.
